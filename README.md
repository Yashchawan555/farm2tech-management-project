#Farm2Tech
Farm2Tech is a digitalized dairy app aimed at empowering rural dairy farmers and small-scale organizations through digital solutions that streamline dairy services.
Key Features:
• Plan Selection: Offers flexible options including "One-Time Order" and 
 "Monthly Subscription" plans.
• Dynamic Order Details: Customers can view specific details like quantity. 
 For monthly subscriptions, selecting a start date dynamically displays the 
 end date.
• Order Editing: For monthly subscriptions, customers can adjust their start 
 date even after placing an order, with some restrictions for dates that have 
 already passed or aligned with the order placement date.
• Subscription Cancellation: Monthly plans can be canceled anytime. If the 
 order is ongoing, partial refunds are available within 2-3 business days 
 based on the remaining delivery days.

 This project is planned in stages, eventually expanding to include a backend and admin panel. Once complete, payment integration will elevate Farm2Tech to full e-commerce standards.
